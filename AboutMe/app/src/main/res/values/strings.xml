        three of the greatest male tennis players of all-time.[c] A Wimbledon junior champion in 1998,
        Federer won his first Grand Slam singles title at Wimbledon in 2003 at age 21. In 2004,
        he won three out of the four major singles titles and the ATP Finals,[d] a feat he repeated in 2006 and 2007.

        he won his fifth consecutive titles at both Wimbledon and the US Open. He completed the career Grand Slam at the 2009
        French Open after three previous runner-ups to Nadal, his main rival up until 2010. At age 27,
        he also surpassed Pete Sampras\'s then-record of 14 Grand Slam men\'s singles titles at Wimbledon in 2009.
